# Server Connection Configuration
server:
  addr: "localhost:4443"

  # TLS Configuration (default: false)
  # Enable TLS for secure gRPC connection to server
  tls: false

  # TLS Certificate File (optional)
  # Path to CA certificate to verify server's certificate
  # - For self-signed certs: path to server.crt from grok-server gencert
  # - For Let's Encrypt: leave empty (uses system CA pool)
  # tls_cert_file: "certs/server.crt"

  # TLS Insecure Mode (default: false)
  # Skip certificate verification - DEVELOPMENT ONLY, NOT for production!
  # Use this only for testing with self-signed certificates
  # tls_insecure: false

  # TLS Server Name (optional)
  # Override server name for certificate verification
  # Useful when connecting via IP but cert is for domain
  # tls_server_name: "grok.io"

  # TLS Examples:
  #
  # 1. Development with self-signed certificate (verify):
  #    tls: true
  #    tls_cert_file: "certs/server.crt"
  #
  # 2. Development with self-signed certificate (skip verify):
  #    tls: true
  #    tls_insecure: true
  #
  # 3. Production with Let's Encrypt:
  #    addr: "grok.io:4443"
  #    tls: true
  #    (no tls_cert_file needed - uses system CA)
  #
  # 4. Production with custom CA:
  #    tls: true
  #    tls_cert_file: "/etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt"
